Version History
---
*4.0*\
Currently under development

*3.5*\
February 2019\
This update enabled LVB to carry out TBR branch-swapping, in addition to the already previously implemented NNI and SPR. It also saw some development to algorithms that tried to identify the most advantageous combinations in which to run the different branch-swapping procedures. Other changes included refinement of the simulated annealing starting temperature, more detailed output statistics, and removal of the MSF input format, bootstrapping and weighting.
